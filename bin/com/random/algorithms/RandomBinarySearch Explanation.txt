Explanation:
1. In this implementation, the RandomBinarySearch method takes an array arr and an element k as input. 
2. It uses a Random object to generate a random index within the current range of the search space. 
3. The algorithm starts with the entire array as the initial search space.
4. At each iteration, a random index is selected, and the corresponding element is compared to the target element k. 
5. If they are equal, the position of the element is returned. 
6. If the random element is less than k, the search space is narrowed to the right half by updating the left index. 
7. If the random element is greater than k, the search space is narrowed to the left half by updating the right index. 
8. The process continues until either the element is found or the search space is exhausted (left > right), indicating that the element is not present in the array.

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n), as it performs a binary search on the array. 
- The randomness introduced by selecting a random index helps in achieving a balanced search and reduces the chance of encountering worst-case scenarios in a traditional binary search.
